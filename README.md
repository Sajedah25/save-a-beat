# Save A Beat (Team Project – Conceptual)


**Save A Beat** is a **conceptual platform** created as part of a software engineering course project. The system was designed to improve the coordination between blood donors, blood banks, and hospitals.

While the platform was not implemented as a real software product, our team followed a full software engineering lifecycle including requirement gathering, system design, and documentation.
